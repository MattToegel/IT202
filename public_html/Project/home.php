        Welcome to Rescue Mission! <br>
        This game is inspired by Wumpus World / Hunt the Wumpus with my own take on it. <br>
        The goal is to traverse as many levels of the Wolf's Den as possible by finding ladders.<br>
        On the way, you may rescue friends for extra points.<br>
        If you run into the Wolf or fall into one of the many pits throughout, you'll lose and get brought back to the first level.<br>
        As you play, you may earn points to use in the Shop to acquire helpful items to push further through the Den.<br>
        You must have an account and be logged in for your score/attempt to persist and be recorded.<br>
        Good luck!
        <br><br>
